# Specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) employs algorithms to comprehend and manipulate human language, representing one of the most widely applied domains of machine learning. As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance, there is a growing demand for professionals with expertise in constructing models that analyze speech and language, unveil contextual patterns, and extract insights from both text and audio data. This specialization is designed to provide the latest deep learning techniques essential for developing cutting-edge NLP systems. Upon completion, participants will be equipped to design NLP applications, including those for question-answering, sentiment analysis, language translation, text summarization, and even chatbot development.

## Program Overview

This program caters to students of machine learning or artificial intelligence and software engineers seeking a deeper understanding of NLP model workings and applications. Prerequisites include a working knowledge of machine learning, intermediate Python skills (including experience with a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or Keras), as well as proficiency in calculus, linear algebra, and statistics. For those needing to enhance these skills, the Deep Learning Specialization by deeplearning.ai and taught by Andrew Ng is recommended.

## Specialization Instructors

The specialization is curated and instructed by two experts in NLP, machine learning, and deep learning:

- **Younes Bensouda Mourri:** AI Instructor at Stanford University and contributor to the Deep Learning Specialization.
- **Łukasz Kaiser:** Staff Research Scientist at Google Brain, co-author of Tensorflow, and contributor to Tensor2Tensor and Trax libraries, as well as the Transformer paper.
